# maze

A maze game I wrote to improve my understanding of how to write GUIs, and especially Rust GUIs

### CLI

`cargo run --release <maze-width> <maze-height>`

If only 0 or 1 numbers are given, defaults are used

### Goal

Get to the green square at bottom right

### Controls

up, left, down, right to move around

r to reset & generate a new maze
