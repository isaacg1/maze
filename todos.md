TODO:

* Incremental display updates

* Make window resizing work better

* Used different timing

Completed:

* Added goal stay
  * Added freezing on completion

* Added default size

* Timer, indicating how long I've been going
  * Change color on completion

* Generate maze from bottom right and top left, not just top left, so harder to trace backwards

* Add average, max, min times

* Timer now uses system time, not incremental time
* Used VecSet in maze generation for fast random sampling
