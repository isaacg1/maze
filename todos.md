TODO:

* Timer, indicating how long I've been going
  * Change color on completion

Generate maze from bottom right and top left, not just top left, so harder to trace backwards
* Display message (Try to reach the goal -> you win) when goal is reached.

* Incremental display updates

Completed:

* Added goal stay
  * Added freezing on completion

* Added default size
